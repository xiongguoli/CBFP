# <font size=6 face='Calibri'>COMPUTATIONAL BIOACTIVITY FINGERPRINT SIMILARITIES TO NAVIGATE THE DISCOVERY OF NOVEL SCAFFOLDS</font>

<font size=4.5 face='Calibri'>As
one of the central tasks of modern medicinal chemistry, scaffold hopping is expected
to lead to the discovery of structural novel biological active compounds and
broaden the chemical space of known active compounds. Due to severe
dependencies on chemical structures, traditional chemical descriptors are
unable to break through the shackles of current scaffolds and find entirely new
chemical entities. Here, we report the computational bioactivity fingerprint
(CBFP), where the predicted activities in multiple quantitative
structure-activity relationship models are integrated to characterize the
biological space of a molecule. In retrospective benchmarks, the CBFP
representation shows outstanding scaffold hopping potential relative to other
chemical descriptors. In the prospective validation for the discovery of novel
inhibitors of poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1, 35 compounds with diverse
structures are tested, 25 of which show detectable growth-inhibitory activity;
beyond this, the most potent (compound 6) has an IC50 of 0.263 nM.
These results support the use of CBFP representation as the bioactivity proxy
of molecules to explore uncharted chemical space and discover novel compounds. </font>
